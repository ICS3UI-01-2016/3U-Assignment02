Question 2
They are the same, this is because in the second
if statement, there is an ! in front of karel.canPickThing())

therefore, instead of turning Right because he can pick the thing up
he turns left because he can't. Similarly in the 1st if statement, Karel
can only turn left if the option to pick the thing up isn't available.
