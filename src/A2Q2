There is two differences between the two lines of code, in the first line there is an exclamation
point before karel.canPickThing and in the other line of code there is not. The exclamation point negates
the expression, so in the first line if that is true, the exclamation point returns it a negative. The
second difference is that the turnLeft and turnRight commands are switched so that the robots will face 
different directions if the scenario occurs.
