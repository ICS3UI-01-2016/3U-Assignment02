2. Yes, both statements do behave the same, as statement 2 is the same as statement 1 but the 
exclamation mark at the beginning of the statement 2 makes the first line of statement 2 opposite of 
of the first line in statement 1. This means the second and third line are flipped in statement 2 when
comparing to the 2nd and 3rd command in statement 1, all due to the exclamation mark at the beginning
of statement 2. Therefore, both of these if-else statements accomplish the same task.
